1. Overview
Application Description: Provide a brief description of the application, its purpose, and any relevant business or technical context.
System Requirements: List out the hardware, software, and IIS version needed for the application to run (e.g., Windows Server version, IIS version, .NET runtime, etc.).
Dependencies: Outline any external dependencies like databases, APIs, or third-party libraries.
2. Prerequisites
IIS Setup: Describe the installation and configuration of IIS, if not already set up (e.g., enabling IIS features like Application Development, Security, etc.).
Required Roles and Features: Specify any IIS roles/features that must be enabled, such as ASP.NET, .NET Framework version, or URL Rewrite.
Permissions: List any necessary permissions (e.g., file system permissions, IIS permissions, database access permissions).
3. Application Code and Files
Source Code: Specify where the source code is located (e.g., Git repository, SVN, etc.).
File Structure: Provide an overview of the folder structure, including the root directory, subdirectories, web.config files, etc.
Configuration Files: Detail the main configuration files (e.g., web.config), any changes required for the IIS environment, and environment-specific settings (development, staging, production).
4. Build Process
Code Compilation: Detail the process for compiling the application (e.g., building via Visual Studio, MSBuild, etc.), specifying target frameworks, output directories, etc.
Package/Deploy: Provide steps to package the application for deployment (e.g., creating a .zip file, using MSDeploy, or setting up CI/CD pipelines).
Versioning: Document the version control strategy (e.g., how to tag releases, how to manage version numbers).
5. IIS Configuration
App Pool Setup:

Name of the app pool.
App pool identity (e.g., ApplicationPoolIdentity, NetworkService, custom identity).
Managed runtime version (e.g., .NET Core, .NET Framework version).
Recycling settings (e.g., time-based, memory usage).
Idle timeout, CPU usage limits, etc.
Website Setup:

Site bindings (HTTP, HTTPS, ports, host names).
SSL/TLS configuration (including certificates, if applicable).
Directory structure in IIS (physical path, virtual directories, etc.).
Authentication & Authorization:

Describe authentication methods used (Windows Authentication, Basic Authentication, etc.).
Any specific roles or permissions required for the application.
Set up authorization rules in IIS.
Error Handling:

Configure custom error pages (404, 500, etc.).
Detailed logging configuration (e.g., which events to log and where logs are stored).
URL Rewrite Rules: If applicable, outline any URL Rewrite rules needed for routing or redirecting requests.

6. Database Configuration
Database Setup:

Specify the database engine (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.) and version.
Include connection string examples, pointing out any placeholders (e.g., <server>, <database>).
Configuration for database authentication (e.g., SQL Server authentication or Windows authentication).
Database Deployment:

How to deploy the database schema (e.g., using SQL scripts or database migrations).
Any post-deployment actions (e.g., seeding initial data).
7. Deployment Process
Deploy to IIS:

Step-by-step guide to deploying the application to IIS.
Include any command-line tools (e.g., appcmd, MSDeploy) or scripts used in the process.
Rolling back deployment (if something goes wrong).
Deploying to multiple environments (staging, production).
Configuration Management:

If using environment-specific settings (e.g., appsettings.json, web.config transformations), detail how these are managed.
Using configuration management tools (like Octopus Deploy, Ansible, or Puppet) if applicable.
8. Post-Deployment Checks
Validate Deployment:

Check IIS logs, event logs, and application logs for errors after deployment.
Run tests to ensure the application is working as expected.
Performance Checks:

Monitor the application for memory usage, CPU usage, and database load.
Security Checks:

Verify SSL/TLS is configured properly.
Ensure no unnecessary HTTP methods (like PUT, DELETE) are allowed.
Review permissions for the application pool identity and file system access.
9. Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

List common issues that may occur during deployment (e.g., permission errors, missing files, IIS configuration problems).
Error Logs:

Explain how to find and interpret IIS logs, application logs, and event logs.
Known Workarounds/Fixes:

Include any known fixes for common issues.
10. Maintenance and Monitoring
Log Management:

How to enable and manage logging in IIS and the application (e.g., custom logging).
Monitoring Tools:

Tools for monitoring the health of IIS (e.g., using IIS Performance Monitor, Application Insights, etc.).
Regular Maintenance Tasks:

IIS app pool recycling, log rotation, database backups, etc.
Scaling the Application:

If applicable, provide steps on how to scale the application horizontally (adding more web servers) or vertically (upgrading hardware).
11. Rollback Process
Rollback Plan:
Document the steps to take in case the deployment needs to be rolled back (e.g., restoring from backup, reverting to previous configuration).
Include a checklist of files, configurations, and databases to revert.
12. Appendix
References: Links to relevant documentation (e.g., IIS, .NET, third-party libraries, etc.).
Glossary: Define technical terms for ease of understanding.
This format ensures that anyone involved in the build or deployment process can follow a consistent set of instructions, avoid common pitfalls, and maintain a stable IIS environment. Would you like more detail on any specific section?
